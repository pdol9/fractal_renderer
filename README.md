# fractal_generator


this is fractal generator with some basic functions (mouse and key zoom, key movement, reseting to initial position and changing colours), using basic graphics library to render images of fractals. 

currently there are only three available fractals: mandelbrot set, julia and burning ship, working on MacOS.
